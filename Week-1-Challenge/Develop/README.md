# Description
    The purpose of this project was to take existing code and a deployed website and refacor the code without affecting the layout of the exisiting webpage.  The technical requirements of this project were to ensure that the application's links all function correctly, the application's CSS selectors and properties are consolidated and organized to follow semantic structure and that the application's CSS file is properly commented. Upon deployment of the application using the live URL the application was required to load without error. The index.html and syle.css pages have been properly sturcted and commented on.
